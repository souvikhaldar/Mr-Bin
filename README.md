The goal of this project is to get a healthy and clean environment. Smart waste management is an idea where we can control lots of problems like dirtiness, pollution and disease. The waste management has to be done instantly else it leads to irregular management which will have adverse effect on nature. The smart waste management is compatible mainly with the concept of smart cities.
The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes is a time consuming and complex process which requires lots of human efforts. Irregular management of waste is a root cause of many of the human problems such as pollution, diseases and has adverse effects on the hygiene of living beings. In order to overcome all these problems, we are proposing the idea of smart waste management system. The main objectives of our proposed system are as follows:
	•	Monitoring the waste management.
	•	Reducing human time and effort.
	•	Providing a smart technology for waste management.
	•	Resulting in healthy and waste ridden environment.

 This system allows the user to know the fill level of each garbage bin in a locality or                  city at all time, to give a cost effective route to the truck drivers.
